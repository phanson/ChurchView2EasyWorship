ChurchView2EasyWorship
======================

This is a dinky little program I made because I was in charge of our church's transition from ChurchView to EasyWorship and there is not an existing free software solution for this problem.

CV2EW takes as input an Access database conforming to the ChurchView database schema (version 3.1) and produces as output a folder of text files named after the songs in the given database. The content of each text file is a CCLI-formatted representation of that song.

This output folder can be imported directly into EasyWorship.
